or use some other integer besides 4 to control the number of cores to utilize.

Installation: 

1. Run `make install' when present working directory is where this file locates. 
   If an older version had been installed by `make install', `make clean` can 
   be used to remove the package built for installation, so that the most 
   recent can be installed.
